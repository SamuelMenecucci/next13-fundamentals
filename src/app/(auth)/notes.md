If I want a certain group of pages to share the same layout, but I don't want the directory in which this group was created to become a path in my url, I can put the directory in parentheses, this way I can access the routes directly without the root directory becoming a route. for example: I created an auth directory and inside it I have sign-in and sign-up. For me to be able to access either of the two (sign-in or sign-up) I need to pass the auth first. so that it is not necessary to pass the auth first, I create the directory as (auth), and now, I can access the routes within it directly, without the need to pass the auth as the path. this way, the layout that I pass in auth will be shared between both (sign-in and sign-up) but the name auth will not be necessary to pass in the url.
